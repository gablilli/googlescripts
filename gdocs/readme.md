## üõ† How to use

### From Google Apps Script UI

1. Open [Google Apps Script](https://script.google.com/) and create a new project.

2. Copy & paste the script into the editor.

3. Add from the services tab the Drive API (V2, do **not** use V3)

4. Replace these variables at the top of the script with your values:

```
const docId = 'YOUR_DOC_ID_HERE';     // Google Docs file ID
const delayMs = 7000; // Delay between requests (ms), increase if you get rate limit errors
```
Save the project (File ‚Üí Save).

5. Click the ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run button to execute the exportNamedVersionsById function.

(The script will ask you to authorize access to your Drive and Docs data ‚Äî just follow the prompts.)

6. After execution, check your specified Drive folder. üéâ

### How to find IDs üîç
Google Docs file ID: Look at your Doc‚Äôs URL:
https://docs.google.com/document/d/DOC_ID/edit
The DOC_ID part is what you need.

Drive folder ID: Open the folder in Google Drive:
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/FOLDER_ID
Copy FOLDER_ID.

### üìã Notes & Tips
If you get HTTP 429 Too Many Requests, increase delayMs (e.g., 10,000 ms = 10 seconds)

Ensure you have edit access to the document and write access to the destination folder

The script logs progress and errors ‚Äî check the Logs panel in the Apps Script editor (View ‚Üí Logs)

You can run the script multiple times; it will export all revisions every time
