# Google Classroom Importer Script
## üöÄ What This Script Does
This Google Apps Script automates the import of:

- Topics

- Materials

- Assignments (Coursework)

- Announcements (with optional comments)

- Submissions (as materials, for archiving)

...into a specific Google Classroom course, using JSON metadata and associated files stored in a Google Drive folder.

## Disclaimer
Obviously, you‚Äôll need to run the script from a different account ‚Äî like a @gmail.com ‚Äúfake teacher‚Äù account. Just invite your personal account (the one you actually want to access the Classroom with), and you‚Äôre good to go.

## üß© Required Google APIs
Before running the script, enable these services:

### ‚úÖ Classroom API

In Apps Script: Services > + Add a service > Google Classroom

### ‚úÖ Drive API

In Apps Script: Resources > Cloud Platform Project > View API Console, then enable Google Drive API

> Make sure you select Drive Api **V2**

## üìÇ Folder Structure Example
The Drive folder (by ID) should look like this:

```
MainImportFolder/
|-- topics.json
|-- materials.json
|--  materials_files/
|   |-- file1.pdf
|   |__ doc1.docx
|-- coursework.json
|-- coursework_files/
‚îÇ   |-- assignment1.docx
|-- announcements.json
|-- submissions.json
|-- submissions_files/
‚îÇ   |-- submission1.pdf
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration
At the top of the script, replace the placeholders with your own:
```
const IMPORT_FOLDER_ID = 'YOUR_DRIVE_FOLDER_ID';
const COURSE_ID = 'YOUR_GOOGLE_CLASSROOM_COURSE_ID';
```
where:
- IMPORT_FOLDER_ID is the Drive folder containing the exported files (you can get the id in drive's url, e.g. https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/YOUR-LONG-TOKEN)
- COURSE_ID ‚Äì is the target Google Classroom course ID (you can get it with this [script](https://github.com/gablilli/googlescripts/blob/main/classroom/courses-ids.gs))

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run
1. Open Google Apps Script.

2. Create a new script project.

3. Copy-paste the entire script.

4. Replace IMPORT_FOLDER_ID and COURSE_ID.

5. Enable the required APIs (see above).

6. Grant Access to make the script work.

7. Run importClassroomData from the Apps Script editor.

8. You will be prompted to authorize access the first time.

## üîí Permissions
When you run the script for the first time, you‚Äôll need to grant authorization to:

Read and manage your Google Classroom data.

Access Google Drive files and folders.

## üìå Notes
Files referenced must be located inside the appropriate subfolders (*_files).

The script handles invalid or missing files gracefully, logging warnings.

All coursework is imported as draft by default. You can publish them manually later.
